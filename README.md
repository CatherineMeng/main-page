## About me

I am a Ph.D student in Computer Engineering at University of Southern California under the advisement of professor [Viktor K. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). 

My research interest is accelerating computationally intensive algorithms on various computing platforms. I am currently working on accelerating Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms on FPGA.
